<h1>Clock with Clocks</h1>

This is a rough recreation made with react of a clock.

It is real clock created by <a href='https://www.humanssince1982.com/a-million-times-san-jose-2021'>humanssince1982</a>. It is called <b>A million Times</b> and is located at the San Jos√© Airport</p>

I used anime js for the animations

The page loads with the correct time but it isn't a working clock (as it it will not update the time unless you click on it)
